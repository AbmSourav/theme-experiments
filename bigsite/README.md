# Big Site

Big Site is an experimental WordPress theme that uses the [Block Style System](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/designers-developers/developers/themes/theme-json.md) and [Block Templates](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/designers-developers/developers/themes/block-based-themes.md) to create a minimal theme demo.

## What's here
