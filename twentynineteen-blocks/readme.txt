Our 2019 default theme is designed to show off the power of the block editor. This version uses block templates.

== Description ==
Twenty Nineteen, but built using block templates. This also includes starter content to begin replicating the Twenty Ninteen demo site. 

To install: 

1. Create a fresh WordPress site
2. Clone this repository or upload a zip into the site’s themes directory
3. Install the Gutenberg plugin
4. Enable the Full Site Editing and Full Site Editing Demo Templates experiments in the Gutenberg > Experiments panel.
5. Activate the "Twenty Nineteen Blocks" theme from within Appearance > Themes.
6. Visit the Customizer and hit "Publish".

Compare the resulting site to the Twenty Nineteen Demo site. It should look pretty similar.
