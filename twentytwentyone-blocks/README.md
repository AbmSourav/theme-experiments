# Twenty Twenty-One Blocks

Ongoing development for the block-based version of Twenty Twenty-One, the default WordPress theme slated for 5.6. 

This theme requires the Gutenberg Plugin to be installed, and the "Full Site Editing" experiment to be activated.

For the non-block-based version of this theme, please [visit the Twenty Twenty-One repository](https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentyone). 

To contribute to TT1 development, please read the [contributor's guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
